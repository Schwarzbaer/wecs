<h1>Subconsole with some bla bla</h1>
<p>
  This is (or will become) a subconsole. It's purpose is to test
  <ul>
    <li>the clicking-on-subconsole-tab-riders, and that only the active subconsole is shown</li>
    <li>basic subconsole functionality</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p id="colorable_text" onclick="call_python();">
  Click this text to color it red. Clicking will call
  `call_py_color_text('red');`, which is a Python function in this
  subconsole's Python code. It will in turn call the JavaScript
  function `color_text`, which finally does the actual recoloring.
